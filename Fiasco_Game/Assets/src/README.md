# Notes on our initial discussion:
We decided to make a 2D top-down game, and design initially for Windows but consider porting to other platforms when we get to that bridge.  The game will take place in a series of "dungeons," which will initially be predefined but may become procedurally generated as the project evolves. 
The hero will move through a series of scenes in a fantasy environment (maybe a beach/island setting rather than the traditional dungeon) that contain multiple rooms. Each scene is a level that has a series of enemies and a final boss. In the initial design, we will shoot for three of these scenes, after which the player will have beaten the game. The general combat style will be modeled after bullet hell (e.g. Binding of Isaac).  

# Game setting: 
The hero shipwrecks on an island. The first level could be a beach, then the second level would be a jungle, and the third would be a volcano. 

In addition to the GitHub repo, I'll throw up a SharePoint doc that we can all edit for communication purposes. We can also add presentations and other docs to this fileshare as the project evolves. 

# Initial tasking:
Seth - Get GitHub repo and SharePoint set up so that we can all track the details and docs related to the project.   
Greyson - Get a version controlled project set up on Unity so that we can all track and merge changes to the project.  
Taylor - Delegate tasks for creating an initial mock-up of the game.   
All - Complete development tasks as designated by Taylor and communicate with other team members as necessary.
