# Notes on our initial discussion:
We decided to make a 2D top-down game, and design initially for Windows but consider porting to other platforms when we get to that bridge.  The game will take place in a series of "dungeons," which will initially be predefined but may become procedurally generated as the project evolves. 
The hero will move through a series of scenes in a fantasy environment (maybe a beach/island setting rather than the traditional dungeon) that contain multiple rooms. Each scene is a level that has a series of enemies and a final boss. In the initial design, we will shoot for three of these scenes, after which the player will have beaten the game. The general combat style will be modeled after bullet hell (e.g. Binding of Isaac).  

# Game setting: 
The hero shipwrecks on an island. The first level could be a beach, then the second level would be a jungle, and the third would be a volcano. The objective of the game is to drop a sacred torch into a volcano, a task that many wayfairers have failed at in the past. In order to do this, the hero must fight past several types of enemies, as well as a final boss in the volcano. 

In addition to the GitHub repo, there is a fileshare located here for collaborating on notes, presentations, and anything else we need:
